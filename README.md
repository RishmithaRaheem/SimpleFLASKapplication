# SimpleFLASKapplication

A simple flask application that uses python Flask framework in PYTHON. 
This application was created when playing around with HTTP via a Python flask local webserver.


Just started learning about Github too, will come back to this when I'm famous :)


Clone the application,
Go to the folder and refer to the link below to kn

python3 -m venv env

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

python -m pip install flask

python -m flask run (run the server.py python file )


The server starts running in http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Enjoy :)
